  I wanted to use to combine the use of images and detailed text in answering the first question to help newbies to Excel and Pivot Tables to recreate my steps. Image use increased accesibility those who use work best visually. 
   
  Questions 2 through 4 offer more streamline descriptions to how I solved for the question since it's the process is almost identical to the first questions, ommiting some key phrases. 
  
  At the end I include information on a story pitch that uses the anaylsis shown throughout this markdown file. I also include 2 potential people to interview and 2 additional sources.

Main Source of Information: The Excel Sheet Itself 
  
  The 5 Questions I Ask of This Data Set:
  
  1. What 5 majors have the highest starting median salaries?
  2. What 5 majors have the lowest starting salaries?
  3. What 5 majors have the largest differences in starting salaries and mid career salaries?
  4. What 5 majors have the highest mid-career 75th percentile salaries?
  5. What 5 majors have the highest mid-career 90th percentile salaries?

    1. Start in the degrees-that-pay-well tab
    2. With a cursor go to the top of the column with the title “Starting Median Salary” and right click.
    3. Select “Sort sheet Z → A”
    4. In order to organize and display it in a pivot table, select the top bar in the very corner.

    17. Then reorganize the data according to how you’d like to display it, here’s my own example.
