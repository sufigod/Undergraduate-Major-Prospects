UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR PROSPECTS - WILL IT PAY OFF?


<h3>

Foreword:
  
  <h5> 
  
  I wanted to use to combine the use of images and detailed text in answering the first question to help newbies to Excel and Pivot Tables to recreate my steps. Image use increased accesibility those who use work best visually. 
   
  Questions 2 through 4 offer more streamline descriptions to how I solved for the question since it's the process is almost identical to the first questions, ommiting some key phrases. 
  
  At the end I include information on a story pitch that uses the anaylsis shown throughout this markdown file. I also include 2 potential people to interview and 2 additional sources.

1. What 5 majors have the highest starting median salaries?
  
  <h3>

    1. Start in the degrees-that-pay-well tab
    2. With a cursor go to the top of the column with the title “Starting Median Salary” and right click.
    3. Select “Sort sheet Z → A”
    4. In order to organize and display it in a pivot table, select the top bar in the very corner.

     Story Pitch & Key Sources

  <h3>
         
From the data gathered above, it seems as if certain majors, particularly within the STEM field are having higher salaries when entering the workforce. Then when majors are mid career, top salary earners based solely on undergraduate majors changes. Lastly, when the 90th Percentile comes into play, we see another shift in majors listed.
    
For the story pitch, I'd like to use the data analysis gathered above to understand how and why certain majors have higher starting salaries compared to others? Is it because of demand? Lastly, What kind of jobs do the top earners in the 90th percentile persue as a career?
    
Most specifically, which majors the have short term benefits in terms of pay and which have the largest in the long term?
         
I believe one of the toughest decisions a young adult makes is in relation to the major they choose, understanding not only their salary prospects, but also where their undergrad might be able to lead them in the long run.
